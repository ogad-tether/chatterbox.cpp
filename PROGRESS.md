# Chatterbox → ggml Port: Development Journal

This document tracks the port of **Chatterbox Turbo** (Resemble AI, MIT license)
to `ggml`, from the first exploratory scoping all the way to the optimized
end-to-end CPU binary, in the order things actually happened.

- **Model**: `ResembleAI/chatterbox-turbo` (text-to-speech, ~450 M params without
  the tokenizer / speaker-encoder).
- **Goal**: end-to-end `text → waveform` in C++/ggml with **bit-exact (or
  float-precision) parity** against the official PyTorch reference.
- **Verification target**: every intermediate tensor within 1e-6 relative error
  of the PyTorch implementation, on CPU.

---

## Current status (end of journey)

Everything runs in pure C++/ggml on CPU. Three binaries:

| Binary | Role |
|--------|------|
| `chatterbox` | text → speech tokens (T3, GPT-2 Medium, 24 layers) |
| `chatterbox-tts` | speech tokens + reference voice → 24 kHz wav (S3Gen + HiFT) |
| `mel2wav` | mel spectrogram → wav (HiFT only, demo) |

Plus `scripts/synthesize.sh` which composes the two into a single command.

**Numerical parity vs PyTorch** on a 2.7 s reference utterance, debug mode
(Python-dumped random bits substituted for reproducibility):

| Stage | rel error vs PyTorch |
|-------|---------------------|
| BPE tokenizer | 10/10 exact-match test cases |
| T3 speech tokens | bit-exact on 4 deterministic prompts |
| S3Gen encoder (full, incl. upsample and encoder_proj) | 4.5e-07 |
| CFM 2-step meanflow decoder | 8.9e-07 on the final mel |
| HiFT decode body (conv_pre → conv_post) | 5.6e-07 |
| ISTFT → waveform | 1.0e-04 |
| End-to-end C++ wav vs Python wav (RMS) | 1.22e-04 vs 1.22e-04 |

**Speed** on a 10-core EPYC for an 8.64 s utterance, after the optimization
pass: **RTF 0.28 (3.6× faster than real-time)** — see §3.8.

A separate machine holds PyTorch + the original Chatterbox repo for reference
runs. On-device (Apple Silicon / Linux x86) the C++ binaries have **no runtime
dependency on Python** — the tokenizer reads `vocab.json` + `merges.txt`
directly.

## Development log (chronological)

### 3.1  Scoping and bootstrap

Surveyed open-source TTS candidates (F5-TTS, Kokoro-82M, XTTS v2, Piper, Fish
Speech, Supertonic, Chatterbox). Picked **Chatterbox Turbo** for three reasons:
MIT license, zero-shot voice cloning, and the "Turbo" variant uses just **2
flow-matching steps** (fast inference).

Bootstrapped the repo by cloning the latest `ggml` and the reference
`resemble-ai/chatterbox` side-by-side, then built a standalone
`qvac-chatterbox.cpp/` with `ggml/` as a vendored subdirectory (no modifications
inside `ggml/`).

**Issues hit in this phase:**

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|-------|-----|
| 1 | `rsync` not on macOS by default | Switched to `tar … \| ssh … tar -x`. |
| 2 | Remote repo polluted with `._*` AppleDouble files | `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 tar …`. |
| 3 | Partial sync left `src/CMakeLists.txt` stray file | Removed; unified sync always pushes the whole tree. |
| 4 | Remote binary `0 bytes` after SSH disconnect | `rm build/<target>` + rebuild. |

### 3.2  T3 port + custom BPE tokenizer

T3 is a GPT-2 Medium-sized (24 layer) autoregressive model that maps text
tokens + voice conditioning to speech tokens.

- Wrote `scripts/convert-t3-turbo-to-gguf.py` to emit a GGUF with built-in
  voice conditionals (`speaker_emb`, `cond_prompt_speech_tokens`) embedded.
- C++ graph in `src/main.cpp`: split into a "prompt" graph and a "step" graph
  sharing a persistent KV cache, mirroring `ggml/examples/gpt-2`.
- Ported the sampler (Temperature → TopK → TopP → RepetitionPenalty).
- Wrote a **self-contained GPT-2 byte-level BPE** in `src/gpt2_bpe.cpp` (llama.cpp's
  BPE was too entangled with its GGUF vocab loading to reuse cleanly):
  byte-level encoding table, regex pre-tokenization, BPE merge loop, plus
  `punc_norm` matching the Python implementation. **10/10** test cases match
  the HF tokenizer byte-for-byte, including the 19 paralinguistic added tokens
  (`[laugh]`, `[chuckle]`, …).
- `chatterbox` binary takes `--text` + `--tokenizer-dir` and produces speech
  tokens end-to-end.

Verified against PyTorch: **bit-for-bit** identical speech tokens on 4
deterministic sampling configs (greedy / temperature / top-k /
repetition-penalty / no-penalty × short + long prompts).

**Issues hit in this phase:**

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|-------|-----|
| 5 | `ggml_can_mul_mat` assertion in T3 | Converter must transpose `Conv1D`-style weights (`c_attn`, `c_proj`, `c_fc`, `mlp.c_proj`) to ggml's `[in, out]` layout while leaving `nn.Linear` / embeddings / `wpe` as-is. |
| 6 | `ggml_backend_tensor_get(input_tensor)` returned garbage | `ggml_gallocr` reuses the input buffer for intermediates when only `set_input` is marked; also call `ggml_set_output` on tensors we want to read back. |
| 7 | Repetition-penalty path diverged from HF at token 22 | HF divides positive logits, multiplies negative ones — I had it backwards. |
| 8 | Sampler order mismatched HF `LogitsProcessorList` | Rewrote `sample_next_token` as Temperature → TopK → TopP → RepetitionPenalty, in HF's exact order. After the fix greedy+penalty tests pass bit-exactly. |

### 3.3  S3Gen encoder (stages A–F)

S3Gen is a "Upsample Conformer" with 10 blocks total (~60 M params): 6 initial
blocks, then a 2× `Upsample1D`, then 4 more blocks. Ported in six staged
substeps against Python-dumped reference tensors (`scripts/dump-s3gen-reference.py`):

| Stage | Component | rel error |
|-------|-----------|----------:|
| A | `speaker_emb` projection (`F.normalize` + Linear) | 1.2e-7 |
| B | `input_embedding` lookup | 0 (exact) |
| C | `encoder_embed` (Linear + LN + √D scale + ESPnet rel PE) | 4.4e-7 |
| D | `PreLookaheadLayer` (asymmetric-padded Conv1d stack) | 2.5e-7 |
| E | One Conformer block (rel-pos MHA + `rel_shift` + Swish FFN) | 1.3e-7 |
| **F** | **Full encoder + `encoder_proj`** | **5.6e-7** |

**Issues hit in this phase:**

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|-------|-----|
| 9  | `ggml_conv_1d` aborted with `src0->type == GGML_TYPE_F16` | ggml's `im2col` path requires F16 kernels, but we wanted F32 precision. Wrote a `conv1d_f32` helper that calls `ggml_im2col(…, GGML_TYPE_F32)` + `mul_mat` directly, keeping kernels in F32. |
| 10 | `speaker_embed` broadcast failed in `cond_spkr` matmul | Bias reshape needed `ne=[1, 256]`, not `ne=[256]`. Added the explicit `reshape_2d(bias, 1, C)` convention for every 1-D bias added to a `[T, C]` conv output. |
| 11 | Nearest-neighbor ×2 upsample produced channel-interleaved garbage | The naive `reshape_3d(T, 1, D) + concat(ne[1])` gives `t0_copy0, t1_copy0, …, t0_copy1, …`. Correct trick: `reshape_3d(1, T, D)` → `concat` along `ne[0]` → `[2, T, D]` → reshape to `[2T, D]`, giving `t0_copy0, t0_copy1, t1_copy0, …`. |
| 12 | `rel_shift` attention gave ~100 % rel error | `view_3d(bd_viewed, T, 2T-1, H, nb1, T*(2T-1)*elem, offset)` used the *sliced* stride for `nb2`. `nb2` must match the *source's* element stride: `bd_viewed->nb[2]`. |
| 13 | `*.transpose().numpy()` reference dumps loaded as garbage in C++ | Torch `.transpose()` yields Fortran-ordered storage; `np.save` writes `fortran_order: True`. Dumper now calls `.contiguous().numpy()` + `np.ascontiguousarray(...)`. The C++ loader throws a clear error if it sees `fortran_order=True`. |

### 3.4  CFM decoder (stages G1–G4)

A U-Net with transformer blocks (~45 M params). Layout: 1 down block → 12 mid
blocks → 1 up block (skip concat) → `final_block` → `final_proj`. Each block
carries 4 `BasicTransformerBlock`s.

| Stage | Component | rel error |
|-------|-----------|----------:|
| G1 | Time embedding (sin → MLP → mixer) | 7.0e-7 |
| G2 | `CausalResnetBlock1D` (causal-conv + LN + Mish + time MLP + res_conv) | 2.9e-7 |
| G3 | `BasicTransformerBlock` (self-attn + FFN w/ GELU-erf) | 1.7e-7 |
| **G4** | **Full CFM decoder, one forward step** | **1.3e-6** |

For meanflow mode we do 2 steps with `t_span = [0, 0.5, 1]`; the time embedding
sees both `t` and `r` concatenated through a mixer.

**Issues hit in this phase:**

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|-------|-----|
| 14 | `LayerNorm` applied over time instead of channel | For `ne=[T, C]` layout `ggml_norm` reduces `ne[0]=T`, which is wrong. Wrote `layer_norm_on_channel` that permutes to `[C, T]`, norms, applies affine, permutes back. |
| 15 | `weight_norm` convolutions in `mel2wav` ignored | Torch 2.6 stores them under `parametrizations.weight.original{0,1}`. Added `expand_weight_norm()` in the converter that fuses `g · v / ‖v‖₂` back into a regular `weight` tensor before export. |
| 16 | Mish activation missing from ggml unary ops | Built from primitives: `x · tanh(softplus(x))` via `GGML_UNARY_OP_SOFTPLUS` + `GGML_UNARY_OP_TANH`. |
| 17 | GELU mismatch in `BasicTransformerBlock` (rel=3e-4) | `ggml_gelu` is the tanh approximation; `diffusers.models.activations.GELU` uses the exact `erf` formulation. Switched to `ggml_gelu_erf`. Error dropped to 1.7e-7. |
| 18 | Python hook overwrote the same tensor across multiple CFM steps | Meanflow calls `time_embeddings` twice (for `t` and `r`) and the decoder runs twice per sample. Added `make_hook(multi_call=True)` that saves `*_call0.npy`, `*_call1.npy`, …. |
| 19 | Estimator `forward_hook` never fired | `basic_euler` calls `self.estimator.forward(x, …)` directly, bypassing `__call__` where hooks live. Monkey-patched `estimator.forward` to record `x_in / mu / t / r / spks / cond / mask / dxdt` for every step. |
| 20 | `(B, C, T)` vs `(B, T, C)` layout confusion | CFM alternates: resnets use `(B, C, T)`, transformer blocks use `(B, T, C)`, switched by `rearrange`. In ggml we mirror this and `cont(permute)` at the boundary. Every helper doc-comments its layout. |

### 3.5  HiFT vocoder (stages H1–H5) + `mel2wav` binary

HiFTGenerator = Neural Source Filter + ISTFTNet. The mel → waveform vocoder.
Ported in five verifiable substeps:

| Stage | Component | rel error |
|-------|-----------|----------:|
| H1 | `f0_predictor` (5× Conv + ELU + Linear) | 4.2e-6 |
| H3 | decode body `conv_pre → ups / rb → conv_post` | 5.6e-7 |
| H4 | STFT (Conv1d with DFT + Hann kernel) | 7.9e-3 (boundary-bound) |
| H5 | ISTFT (ConvTranspose + window-sum normalize) | 1.0e-4 |

Key techniques:

- **Snake activation** `x + (1/α)·sin²(αx)` implemented with `ggml_sin` and a
  pre-computed `1/α` tensor fed as a graph input (72 such inputs across the 9
  main ResBlocks and 3 source ResBlocks).
- **ConvTranspose1d with asymmetric PyTorch padding**: ggml's op only accepts
  `p0=0`, so we compute the full-length output then slice `p` samples from each
  side.
- **Asymmetric reflection pad `(1, 0)`**: done manually by extracting `x[1:2]`
  and concat-prepending it.
- **STFT** as `Conv1d` with a DFT+window kernel of shape `[n_fft, 1, 2F]` (real
  and imaginary parts stacked as output channels). Center-mode reflection pad
  `n_fft//2` applied manually via slice-and-concat on each side.
- **ISTFT** as `ConvTranspose1d` with the inverse DFT+window kernel, followed
  by element-wise divide by a precomputed `window²` overlap-sum buffer, then
  trim `n_fft//2` from each end.

The resulting `mel2wav` binary demonstrates the full vocoder:

```
mel2wav --s3gen-gguf models/chatterbox-s3gen.gguf \
        --mel-npy artifacts/s3gen-ref/mel_output.npy \
        --out /tmp/out.wav
```

Against the Python reference waveform: matching RMS (1.22e-04 vs 1.22e-04),
time-domain diff max 3.3e-05 (signal max ~9e-04), spectrogram magnitude diff
max rel 2.5 % (entirely from stochastic SineGen excitation; the deterministic
conv-net chain is bit-exact).

SineGen on the C++ side uses `std::mt19937` (not bit-exact to `torch.rand`,
but audibly indistinguishable — the excitation is a small-amplitude additive
noise term).

### 3.6  End-to-end wiring: `chatterbox-tts` + `synthesize.sh`

Final plumbing: write `src/chatterbox_tts.cpp` that wires the S3Gen encoder →
2-step meanflow CFM → HiFT vocoder and emits a 24 kHz wav. Takes T3-generated
speech tokens plus a reference voice (`embedding`, `prompt_token`,
`prompt_feat`).

`scripts/synthesize.sh` runs `chatterbox` → pipe tokens → `chatterbox-tts`,
giving a single-command `text → wav` path.

Debug mode (`--debug`) substitutes Python-dumped reference random bits (CFM
`z` and `noised_mels`) so the deterministic parts can be validated
bit-exactly. End-to-end in debug mode:

| Stage | max_abs | rel |
|-------|---------|-----|
| `input_embedding(tokens)` | 0 | 0 |
| encoder → `encoder_proj` (mu) | 8.3e-07 | 4.5e-07 |
| speaker embedding (spks) | 5.9e-08 | small |
| `cond` (prompt_feat placement) | 0 | 0 |
| `t_emb` (sinusoidal → MLP → mixer) | 7.6e-06 | small |
| CFM step 0 `dxdt` | 2.1e-05 | small |
| CFM step 1 `dxdt` | 1.8e-05 | small |
| final mel (80 × 136) | 1.0e-05 | **8.9e-07** |

Production mode uses a seeded `std::mt19937` for both the CFM initial noise
and SineGen excitation.

**Issues hit in this phase (all three caused plausible-looking but wrong output
before being found):**

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|-------|-----|
| 21 | Silence-token padding value | `speech_tokens` must be appended with `S3GEN_SIL = 4299` (not 0) to match Python's `speech_tokens_padded` convention. |
| 22 | Relative PE `pos_pe / neg_pe` swap | While copying `compute_pos_emb` into the new binary I flipped the two halves of the PE buffer, which silently gave ~20 % relative error in the encoder output. Restored the correct ordering: first half is reversed `pos_pe`, second half is `neg_pe`. |
| 23 | `mu` layout transpose between encoder and CFM | `encoder_proj.npy` is numpy `(T, 80)` but the CFM estimator expects numpy `(80, T)`. Added an explicit transpose to bridge the two. |

At this point on a 10-core EPYC, single-threaded, the end-to-end pipeline ran
in **22.5 s for 8.64 s of audio** — **RTF 2.60**, i.e. 2.6× *slower* than
real-time.

### 3.7  (no extra section — continued in 3.8)

### 3.8  CPU optimization pass (in the order tried)

Eight optimizations in the order they were attempted. Four landed, four were
rolled back or skipped as incompatible. Numbers are for the 8.64 s utterance
above.

**Attempt 1 — multi-threading (KEPT, −85 % wall time)**
Baseline was pinned to 1 thread because the code never called
`ggml_backend_cpu_set_n_threads`. Added a global `g_n_threads` (default =
`std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`, overridable with `--threads N`) and a
`compute()` helper that sets it before every `ggml_backend_graph_compute`.
ggml's `-march=native` was already on, so AVX-512 / AVX-VNNI kernels were
already in use — the missing piece was parallelism. Swept thread counts: 10
was the sweet spot; 16 oversubscribes and regresses.
Result: **22.5 s → 3.47 s (RTF 2.60 → 0.40)**.

**Attempt 2 — OpenBLAS (TRIED, NO HELP)**
Installed `libopenblas-dev`, rebuilt with `GGML_BLAS=ON
GGML_BLAS_VENDOR=OpenBLAS`. No measurable change. Our matmuls are medium-sized
and ggml's hand-written AVX-512 kernels already saturate what OpenBLAS would
deliver. Kept off.

**Attempt 3 — `GGML_LTO=ON` (TRIED, NO HELP)**
No measurable effect on a shared-library build. Kept off.

**Attempt 4 — CFM graph reuse (KEPT, −11 % wall time)**
The CFM estimator is called twice per utterance with *identical* graph
topology. Stashed the `ggml_context`, `ggml_cgraph`, and `ggml_gallocr` in a
`cfm_estimator_cache` so step 2 only re-runs with new inputs — saves one graph
construction and one `gallocr_reserve` pass per utterance.
Result: **3.47 s → 3.09 s (RTF 0.40 → 0.36)**.

**Attempt 5 — Flash attention in CFM `BasicTransformerBlock` (KEPT, −22 % wall time)**
The CFM has 56 `BasicTransformerBlock`s × 2 meanflow steps = **112 attention
ops** per utterance. Replaced the explicit
`softmax(QKᵀ / √d) · V` kernel with a single `ggml_flash_attn_ext` call.
The pattern is pure self-attention (no masking, no bias), which is exactly
what `flash_attn_ext` is designed for. Fused, no materialized `T×T`
scores/attn tensors. The reshape-permute-cont preamble now drops straight into
`flash_attn_ext`, and its output `ne=[HD, H, T, 1]` reshapes directly to
`[INNER, T]`.
Result: **3.09 s → 2.45 s (RTF 0.36 → 0.28), CFM −44 %**.

**Attempt 6 — Fold symmetric conv padding (KEPT, small win)**
Six redundant `ggml_pad_ext → conv1d_f32` pairs dropped by passing the padding
straight to `ggml_im2col`. Biggest impact in HiFT's ResBlocks where the
resblock-conv path runs ~72 times per decode. Saves one intermediate tensor
allocation per conv. A small but essentially-free improvement.
Result: **2.45 s → 2.39 s (RTF 0.28 steady)**.

**Attempt 7 — F16 CFM linear weights (TRIED, ROLLED BACK)**
Converted all Q/K/V/O/FFN/MLP linear weights in CFM from F32 to F16 to halve
memory bandwidth. *Regressed*: CFM got ~10 % **slower** and precision dropped
to `rel = 3e-4` on the final mel. The F16→F32 upconvert inside `mul_mat` is
not free and the F32 AVX-512 kernel is already very fast; for CPU this is a
net loss. Reverted.

**Attempt 8 — Flash attention in the Conformer encoder (SKIPPED, INCOMPATIBLE)**
Would fuse another 10 attention ops per utterance, but the Conformer uses
ESPnet-style relative positional bias added *inside* the softmax, and
`ggml_flash_attn_ext` does not support custom in-softmax bias terms. Would
need a custom ggml op — not done.

#### Final results (10-core EPYC, 8.64 s output)

| Configuration | Total | RTF | vs real-time |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Baseline (1 thread, no graph reuse, no flash attn) | 22.5 s | 2.60 | 2.6× slower |
| + threading (Attempt 1) | 3.47 s | 0.40 | 2.5× faster |
| + CFM graph reuse (Attempt 4) | 3.09 s | 0.36 | 2.8× faster |
| **+ flash attn + pad fold (Attempts 5, 6)** | **2.39 s** | **0.28** | **3.6× faster** |

Total wall-time speedup from the original port: **9.4×**.

Stage breakdown at the final configuration:

| Stage | time |
|-------|------|
| S3Gen encoder | 286 ms |
| CFM 2 meanflow steps | 785 ms |
| HiFT vocoder | 1312 ms |
| **Total** | **2.39 s** |

HiFT is now the bottleneck (~55 % of wall time) — the 3-stage upsample /
ResBlock stack on `T = 16320 × 64` channels is memory-bandwidth bound rather
than compute bound.

### 3.9  Post-launch bug: sampling defaults collapsed long prompts into silence

After merging the two binaries and shipping voice-cloning phase 1, a user
report of an "empty" wav on paragraph-length input surfaced a sampling bug
that had been lurking since the T3 port.

Symptom: the produced wav had ~1 second of speech followed by ~9 seconds of
pure zero RMS. Per-0.5 s window RMS:

```
[3.5e-2, 1.3e-2, 2.8e-7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.4e-7]
```

Dumping the T3 token stream showed the root cause immediately — 240 of 257
tokens were the silence token `4218`:

```
tokens[0:17]:   3704, 6486, 4299, 3891, 5832, 4384, 5014, 5665, 2486, 29,
                29, 380, 632, 2912, 5101, 5070, 4215
tokens[17:257]: 4218, 4218, 4218, 4218, ...  (240 copies)
```

The C++ sampler had shipped with `top_k = 1` (argmax) as its default. For
Chatterbox T3 that's a known failure mode: once the model generates a
silence token at a natural pause, `argmax(logits)` keeps picking silence
forever and the utterance never recovers. Short test prompts never reached
a pause so the bug was invisible during the port.

Compared `ChatterboxTurboTTS.generate()` in `tts_turbo.py` — the Python
defaults are very different:

|                | before (C++ broken) | Python     | after (C++ fixed) |
|----------------|--------------------:|-----------:|------------------:|
| `top_k`        | 1  (greedy)         | 1000       | **1000**          |
| `top_p`        | 1.0                 | 0.95       | **0.95**          |
| `temperature`  | 1.0                 | 0.8        | **0.8**           |
| `repeat_penalty`| 1.0                | 1.2        | **1.2**           |
| `n_predict`    | 256                 | ~1000      | **1000**          |

All four knobs are still exposed on the CLI, so `--top-k 1` reproduces the
old greedy behaviour for debugging/comparison.

After the fix, same prompt same seed:

- total wav RMS: `8.3e-03` → `4.8e-02`
- max amplitude: `0.18` → `0.50`
- per-0.5 s RMS windows: all 21 non-zero (3.3e-2 … 8.5e-2 range)
- audible speech for the full 10.7 s

Committed as [`bb0eb99`](https://github.com/gianni-cor/chatterbox.cpp/commit/bb0eb99).

### Lesson

This one was avoidable — the verification pipeline in §5 is per-tensor
numerical parity, which is oblivious to sampler choices; the `reference-
t3-turbo.py` harness only compared greedy token sequences so it never
exercised any non-trivial pass of the sampling ladder. Worth adding an
end-to-end sampling test to the validation list: run T3 with Python's
stochastic defaults (fixed seed) and compare the full token stream
byte-for-byte against C++ with the same seed.

### 3.10  Benchmark: chatterbox.cpp vs ONNX addon on the same machine

Compared end-to-end throughput against the in-house
`qvac-lib-infer-onnx-tts` addon (ONNX Runtime backend, pre-built q4
Chatterbox models at 692 MB on disk). Same 10-core EPYC host, same
prompt ("Hello from native C plus plus. This audio was generated end
to end on CPU using ggml."), built-in voice on both sides, `--threads 10`
for ggml, ORT's own default threading for ONNX. Each configuration run
three times after a disk-cache warm-up; all reported numbers are stable
across the three runs.

**Model footprint on disk:**

| | Size |
|---|---:|
| ONNX q4 (5 files: tokenizer, speech_encoder, embed_tokens, conditional_decoder, language_model) | 692 MB |
| ggml F16 (T3 + S3Gen) | 1285 MB |
| ggml Q8_0 (T3 + S3Gen) | 1004 MB |
| ggml Q5_0 (T3 + S3Gen) | 893  MB |
| ggml Q4_0 (T3 + S3Gen) | 857  MB |

**End-to-end runtime (load + generate, shorter is better):**

| Pipeline | Load (s) | Generate (s) | Total wall (s) | Audio out (s) | RTF (total) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **ONNX q4** (addon)               | 4.30 | 6.87  | **11.17** | 5.88 | 1.90× slower |
| **ggml F16** (chatterbox.cpp)     |  —   |  —    |  **5.71** | 6.56 | 0.87× slower |
| **ggml Q8_0** (chatterbox.cpp)    |  —   |  —    |  **4.84** | 6.56 | 0.74× slower |
| **ggml Q5_0** (chatterbox.cpp)    |  —   |  —    |  **4.67** | 6.64 | 0.70× slower |
| **ggml Q4_0** (chatterbox.cpp)    |  —   |  —    |  **4.42** | 6.48 | **0.68× (1.5× real-time)** |

(For ggml the T3 GGUF load overlaps with prompt-graph construction, so
split load/gen numbers are ambiguous; only the total wall time is
directly comparable.)

**Stage breakdown for ggml Q4_0** (the recommended production preset):

| Stage                                    | time   |
|------------------------------------------|-------:|
| T3 load + T3 inference (~161 tokens)     | 2.08 s |
| S3Gen GGUF load (1945 tensors)           | 0.37 s |
| S3Gen encoder + CFM + HiFT               | 1.97 s |
| **Total wall**                           | **4.42 s** |

**Headline numbers:**

- **ggml Q4_0 is 2.53× faster than ONNX q4 end-to-end on identical
  hardware** (11.17 s → 4.42 s).
- Even **ggml F16 beats ONNX q4** (5.71 s vs 11.17 s, 1.96× faster),
  despite being 2× the weights — i.e. the ONNX backend loses to an
  un-quantized ggml build on the same CPU.
- **Load alone** for ONNX (4.30 s, the four ONNX models come up one by
  one) already exceeds the *total* wall time of any ggml Q* variant.
- **RTF < 1** (faster than real-time) only happens on the ggml side;
  ONNX trails at 1.9× real-time for this prompt.

## Verification approach

Staged pipeline:

1. **Python reference dumper** (`scripts/dump-s3gen-reference.py`) runs the
   full PyTorch pipeline with `forward_hook`s on every module we plan to
   reimplement. Each intermediate is saved as `.npy` in
   `artifacts/s3gen-ref/` with a predictable name. Multi-call hooks save a
   `_call{N}` suffix so each flow-matching step gets its own tensor.
2. **C++ staged harness** (`src/test_s3gen.cpp`) loads a single GGUF, and for
   each stage: loads the reference tensors as inputs, builds a tiny ggml
   graph covering exactly that stage, runs it, reads back outputs, and calls
   `compare_f32(got, expected, n)` to print
   `max_abs / mean_abs / rms / max|ref| / rel`.
3. For T3 we additionally have **bit-exact** testing — under greedy decoding
   ggml speech tokens equal PyTorch speech tokens token-for-token.
4. For `chatterbox-tts` we have `--debug` mode that substitutes Python-dumped
   random bits for the stochastic parts, pinning the comparison.

Precision regressions are immediately visible: a change that drops rel to
~1e-4 shows up at stage N+1 before silently corrupting the full pipeline.

## Still on the table

Ranked by impact-per-effort ratio, from biggest wins to niche polish.

### Tier A — biggest wins, should be tackled next

#### A1. Voice cloning — **phases 1, 2a-2c, 2d DONE**, phase 2e pending

Voice cloning works end-to-end TODAY using a Python preprocessing
helper that produces a five-tensor voice profile from a reference
`.wav`. The C++ binary accepts it via `--ref-dir DIR`.

**Phase 1 (DONE)** — Python helper + C++ wiring:

- `scripts/prepare-voice.py`: wraps
  `ChatterboxTurboTTS.prepare_conditionals()` to produce a directory
  with `speaker_emb.npy` (T3 256-d) + `cond_prompt_speech_tokens.npy`
  (T3 ≤375 int32) + `embedding.npy` (S3Gen 192-d) + `prompt_token.npy`
  (S3Gen int32) + `prompt_feat.npy` (S3Gen mel, 80-channel).
- `src/main.cpp`: when `--ref-dir` is set, overwrite the T3 side in
  place (`model.builtin_speaker_emb`) or, when the prompt-tokens length
  differs from the GGUF's built-in (audio < 15 s → fewer tokens),
  allocate a fresh tensor in `ctx_override` + `buffer_override` on the
  same backend and repoint `model.builtin_cond_prompt_tokens` at it.
  `hparams.cond_prompt_len` is updated to match so `build_prompt_graph`
  sizes the sequence correctly.
- `src/chatterbox_tts.cpp`: the S3Gen side already reads the same three
  `.npy` files when `ref_dir` is non-empty.

End user workflow:

```bash
python scripts/prepare-voice.py --ref-audio me.wav --out voices/me/
./build/chatterbox --model models/chatterbox-t3-turbo.gguf \
                   --s3gen-gguf models/chatterbox-s3gen.gguf \
                   --ref-dir voices/me/ \
                   --text "Hello in my voice." \
                   --out out.wav
```

Verified end-to-end on the remote EPYC: override prints
`overrode T3 built-in voice from voices/test (speaker_emb=256,
cond_prompt_tokens=260)`, the synthesis runs at RTF 0.44, the output
wav plays back cleanly on the Mac.

**Phase 2a (DONE)** — C++ WAV I/O + sinc resampler + 80-ch log-mel at 24 kHz:

- `src/dr_wav.h` (public-domain single header, MIT-0 fallback) vendored
  as a bundled WAV loader (all PCM variants, any sample rate,
  auto-mono).
- `src/voice_features.{h,cpp}`: `wav_load`, `resample_sinc`
  (Kaiser-windowed, beta=8.6, configurable tap count), and
  `mel_extract_24k_80`. The mel extractor is a direct port of
  `s3gen.utils.mel.mel_spectrogram` (`n_fft=1920`, `hop=480`,
  `win=1920`, `fmin=0`, `fmax=8000`, `center=False`, reflect-pad 720).
- `scripts/convert-s3gen-to-gguf.py` now also bakes in the precomputed
  librosa mel filterbank (`librosa.filters.mel(sr=24000, n_fft=1920,
  n_mels=80, fmin=0, fmax=8000)`, a `(80, 961)` float32 matrix) as
  `s3gen/mel_fb/24k_80`. Runtime has no librosa dep.
- Two validation binaries: `test-resample` (24 kHz → 48 kHz → 24 kHz
  round-trip on a 4-tone signal, expects **> 60 dB SNR**) and
  `test-voice-features MODEL.gguf REF.wav PROMPT_FEAT.npy` (compares
  C++ 80-ch log-mel against a Python-dumped `prompt_feat.npy`).

Measured on 10-core EPYC:

| Check                                            | Result |
|---|---|
| Resampler round-trip (4-tone, 24k ↔ 48k)         | **95.75 dB SNR** |
| Mel parity vs Python `prompt_feat.npy` (rel)     | **8.3e-08**      |

(The ~500-frame Python reference truncates at DEC_COND_LEN = 10 s; the
C++ side produces an extra ~20 frames for a 10.4 s input wav but the
overlapping 500 × 80 values match to float precision.)

Implementation notes:

- First attempt at `resample_sinc` was a polyphase decomposition with
  a Kaiser-windowed sinc prototype; the phase-indexing convention was
  subtly wrong and gave **0 dB SNR** on the round-trip. Swapped for
  straightforward "fractional-index sinc interpolation at each output
  sample" which is correct and still fast enough for one-shot voice
  preprocessing.
- `mel_extract_24k_80` uses a naive O(n_fft) DFT per frame, not an FFT.
  For a 10 s reference that's ~520 frames × 1920 × 961 ≈ 960 M mults,
  well under 2 s on CPU. Fine for preprocessing; an FFT is a trivial
  follow-up if this ever needs to be streaming.

**Phase 2b (DONE)** — `--reference-audio PATH.wav` wired into `main.cpp`.
The CLI now accepts a reference wav, runs the whole WAV→prompt_feat
chain in C++, and injects the result into `s3gen_synthesize_opts`
(new `prompt_feat_override` field) so the S3Gen+HiFT pipeline consumes
it directly — no temp file, no npy round-trip. The other four voice
tensors still come from `--ref-dir` for now.

User workflow:

```bash
python scripts/prepare-voice.py --ref-audio me.wav --out voices/me/
./build/chatterbox \
    --model models/chatterbox-t3-turbo.gguf \
    --s3gen-gguf models/chatterbox-s3gen.gguf \
    --ref-dir voices/me/ \
    --reference-audio me.wav \
    --text "Voice-cloned with C++ mel." \
    --out out.wav
```

Verified end-to-end: `voice: prompt_feat shape=(520, 80)` /
`prompt_feat: using C++ override (520 mel frames)` / audible cloned
voice at RTF 0.76 on 10-core EPYC.

**Phase 2c (DONE)** — C++ VoiceEncoder: 3-layer unidirectional LSTM +
Linear(256 → 256) + ReLU + L2-normalise, 40-channel 16 kHz power-mel in,
256-d speaker embedding out.

New files:
- `src/voice_encoder.{h,cpp}` — weights loader (reads 14 tensors from
  the t3 GGUF + `voice_encoder/mel_fb`), plain-C++ LSTM forward pass
  (no ggml graph), partial-window averaging that exactly reproduces
  `VoiceEncoder.embeds_from_wavs(..., as_spk=False)` for a single wav:
  mel is split into overlapping 160-frame partials using
  `get_frame_step`/`get_num_wins`, each partial produces an L2-normed
  256-d embedding via LSTM + projection, then the per-partial embeds
  are averaged and L2-normed once more.
- `src/test_voice_encoder.cpp` — parity harness; compares the C++
  256-d `speaker_emb` against Python `speaker_emb.npy` using
  `max_abs`, `rms`, `rel` and cosine similarity.

Converter change: `scripts/convert-t3-turbo-to-gguf.py` now bakes in
the VE weights (`weight_ih_l{0,1,2}`, `weight_hh_l{0,1,2}`,
`bias_{i,h}h_l{0,1,2}`, `proj/weight`, `proj/bias`) plus the librosa
(40, 201) mel filterbank as `voice_encoder/mel_fb`, and writes VE
hyperparameters (n_mels, hidden_size, num_layers, partial_frames,
sample_rate, n_fft, hop_size, win_size, overlap, rate, min_coverage)
as GGUF metadata so we never need `ve.safetensors` at runtime.  The
`similarity_{weight,bias}` params are skipped — they're only used for
speaker-verification training, not embedding extraction.

Feature extraction: `src/voice_features.cpp` gained
`mel_extract_16k_40`, which shares the STFT/mel core with
`mel_extract_24k_80` but uses the VE-specific knobs (`center=True`,
`power_exponent=2`, no log compression).

CLI wiring: `main.cpp` now resolves the T3 voice override in two
independent pieces.  If `ref_dir/speaker_emb.npy` is missing but
`--reference-audio PATH.wav` is given AND the T3 GGUF has VE weights,
it loads the wav, resamples to 16 kHz, and computes `speaker_emb` in
C++ via `voice_encoder_embed()`.  `cond_prompt_speech_tokens` still
comes from `ref_dir` until Phase 2e. Logs distinguish the source:
`T3 voice override — speaker_emb=C++ VoiceEncoder, cond_prompt_tokens=ref_dir`.

Verification on 10.4 s reference wav:

```
[result] C++ vs Python speaker_emb:
    n=256  max_abs=1.71e-05  rms=2.58e-06  max|ref|=2.45e-01  rel=6.97e-05
    cosine similarity = 1.000000
```

Cosine = 1.000000 confirms angular match to 6 decimal places; the
~1e-5 absolute error is pure float32 accumulation noise.  End-to-end
synthesis with `speaker_emb.npy` *deleted* from the voice dir produced
a 276 kB WAV that plays cleanly on macOS — the C++-computed speaker
embedding drives T3 conditioning indistinguishably from Python.

Two down, two to go (`embedding` and `prompt_token` via CAMPPlus +
S3TokenizerV2).

**Phase 2d-a (DONE)** — C++ CAMPPlus forward pass, validated end-to-end
against the Python reference on a Python-dumped 80-ch Kaldi fbank.

CAMPPlus is a FunASR/3D-Speaker x-vector: 937 raw tensors (329 conv /
linear weights + 122 BatchNorms + biases + counters).  Structure:

```
  fbank (T, 80)
    → FCM: Conv2d(1→32, k=3) + BN + 2× BasicResBlock (stride=2)
              + 2× BasicResBlock (stride=2) + Conv2d(32→32, s=(2,1))
              + reshape → (320, T)
    → xvector.tdnn: Conv1d(320→128, k=5, s=2) + BN + ReLU
    → 3 × CAMDenseTDNNBlock + TransitLayer
         block1: 12 layers, dilation=1  → 128 → 512
         transit1: Conv1x1 + BN: 512 → 256
         block2: 24 layers, dilation=2  → 256 → 1024
         transit2: 1024 → 512
         block3: 16 layers, dilation=2  → 512 → 1024
         transit3: 1024 → 512
    → out_nonlinear (BN + ReLU)
    → stats_pool (mean + unbiased std over T → 1024)
    → dense: Conv1x1(1024→192) + BN(affine=False) → 192
```

Each `CAMDenseTDNNLayer` is `BN→ReLU→Conv1x1→BN→ReLU→CAMLayer`, with
`CAMLayer` being `linear_local × sigmoid(linear2(ReLU(linear1(ctx))))`
where `ctx = mean(x, T) + seg_pool(x, 100).expand(T)`.

Ports:
- `scripts/convert-s3gen-to-gguf.py` — fuses every BatchNorm into a
  per-channel `(scale, shift)` pair at export time:
    `scale = gamma / sqrt(var + eps)` (or `1/sqrt(var + eps)` when
    `affine=False`), `shift = beta - mean*scale`.  Skips
    `num_batches_tracked`.  Embeds 14 `campplus.*` hyperparameters as
    GGUF metadata and emits the 451 substantive tensors under
    `campplus/…` (329 conv + 122 fused BNs).
- `src/campplus.{h,cpp}` — plain-C++ forward pass, no ggml graph.
  Uses channel-major `(C, T)` layout throughout.  Helpers: `bn_apply`,
  `relu_inplace`, `sigmoid_inplace`, `conv1d`, `conv2d`,
  `seg_pool_expand` (avg-pool with `ceil_mode=True` + repeat-interleave
  to `T`), `stats_pool` (mean + unbiased std).  Module-level helpers
  `fcm_basic_resblock`, `fcm_forward`, `cam_layer_forward`,
  `cam_dense_tdnn_layer_forward`.  Parallelised via OpenMP.
- `src/test_campplus.cpp` — loads CAMPPlus from `chatterbox-s3gen.gguf`,
  runs on a Python-dumped `fbank.npy`, compares with Python
  `embedding.npy` using max_abs / rms / rel / cosine similarity.
- `scripts/dump-campplus-reference.py` — helper that loads the turbo
  checkpoint, runs `extract_feature` (Kaldi fbank + per-utterance
  mean-subtract) and `speaker_encoder.forward`, and dumps the two
  tensors to `.npy`.

Result on a 10.4 s reference wav (1038 fbank frames, 192-d output):

```
[result] C++ vs Python embedding:
    n=192  max_abs=2.34e-05  rms=6.99e-06  max|ref|=2.49e+00  rel=9.38e-06
    cosine similarity = 1.000000
    forward pass: 549.9 ms (16-thread EPYC)
```

`rel = 9.4 ppm`, cosine = 1.000000 — numerical parity. 550 ms for a
one-time voice-setup pass is comfortably fast.

`src/s3gen_pipeline.h` grew an `embedding_override` field and
`src/chatterbox_tts.cpp` reads it in place of `ref_dir/embedding.npy`
when provided, mirroring `prompt_feat_override`.  End-to-end wiring
into `main.cpp` is blocked on Phase 2d-b (Kaldi fbank port) — we can't
feed CAMPPlus from `--reference-audio` until the C++ binary can
extract its own fbank.

**Phase 2d-b (DONE)** — C++ port of
`torchaudio.compliance.kaldi.fbank` with `num_mel_bins=80`.
Implemented as `fbank_kaldi_80` in `src/voice_features.{h,cpp}`
with all the Kaldi knobs baked in:

- `frame_length = 25 ms = 400 samples`, `hop = 10 ms = 160 samples`
- `round_to_power_of_two = True` → `n_fft = 512`
- `window_type = "povey"` = `hann(N, periodic=False) ** 0.85`
- `remove_dc_offset = True` (subtract per-frame mean)
- `preemphasis_coefficient = 0.97`, with the Kaldi edge case
  `out[0] = frame[0] * (1 - coeff)`
- `use_power = True`, `use_log_fbank = True` with `log_floor = FLT_EPSILON`
- `snip_edges = True`, `dither = 0`
- Kaldi mel filterbank (`mel = 1127 * log(1 + f / 700)`, triangular
  filters equally spaced in mel-space) precomputed by
  `convert-s3gen-to-gguf.py` and baked in as
  `campplus/mel_fb_kaldi_80` (shape `(80, 257)`).

Key gotcha we hit: **torchaudio's Kaldi wrapper does _not_ apply
the `×32768` int16 scaling that real Kaldi does.**  With the scale
our output was +20.8 units offset from Python (exactly
`2 * log(32768) ≈ 20.79`).  Dropped the scale and `rel` jumped from
`1.30` to `1.77e-05`.

Validation on the synthetic 10 s speech signal:

```
[result] C++ vs Python fbank:
    n=79840  max_abs=2.82e-04  rms=5.91e-06  max|ref|=1.59e+01  rel=1.77e-05

C++ fb[0, :8]: -10.1011 -8.3549 -7.9557 -7.4304 -7.0186 ...
Py  fb[0, :8]: -10.1012 -8.3549 -7.9557 -7.4304 -7.0186 ...
```

**Phase 2d-c (DONE)** — Wired into `main.cpp`.  New
`compute_embedding_native()` glues `wav_load → resample_sinc →
fbank_kaldi_80 → mean-subtract over T → campplus_embed` and
populates the new `embedding_override` field in
`s3gen_synthesize_opts`.  Called best-effort from both short-circuit
and regular T3→S3Gen paths: if the s3gen GGUF pre-dates Phase 2d-a
(no CAMPPlus tensors), it silently falls back to
`ref_dir/embedding.npy`.

End-to-end dogfood on the 10.4 s reference wav with
`speaker_emb.npy` _and_ `embedding.npy` deleted from `voices/test/`:

```
voice_encoder: computing speaker_emb from /tmp/unified_remote.wav
main: T3 voice override — speaker_emb=C++ VoiceEncoder, cond_prompt_tokens=ref_dir
voice: prompt_feat shape=(520, 80)
voice: embedding shape=(192,) via CAMPPlus (1038 fbank frames)
  embedding:   using C++ override (CAMPPlus, 192 dims)
  prompt_feat: using C++ override (520 mel frames)
```

Output WAV plays cleanly and sounds identical to the Python
voice-cloned output.  Only `cond_prompt_speech_tokens.npy` and
`prompt_token.npy` still live in `ref_dir` — both are produced by
`S3TokenizerV2`, the last holdout (Phase 2e).

**Phase 2d (old)** — C++ CAMPPlus (TDNN + stats pooling speaker encoder,
80-ch Fbank at 16 kHz → 192-d `embedding`). ~400-line Python, mostly
dilated 1-D conv stacks; mean/std pooling is trivial to implement.

**Phase 2e** — C++ S3TokenizerV2 (~600-line wav2vec-style encoder
with FSMN attention + FSQ codebook). Biggest lift; needs stage-by-stage
verification against Python dumps (same approach as S3Gen encoder port
in §3.3). Produces both the T3 `cond_prompt_speech_tokens` and the
S3Gen `prompt_token` streams.

When 2c-2e all land, `scripts/prepare-voice.py` becomes redundant and
`chatterbox --reference-audio file.wav ...` runs the whole voice
cloning pipeline in pure C++.

Impact: even Phase 1 alone unlocks "zero-shot voice cloning" as a usable
feature — the flagship reason anyone picks Chatterbox in the first
place.

#### A2. GPU backend (Metal first, then CUDA)

The code already uses `ggml_backend_t` abstractions everywhere and the
CMake flags `GGML_METAL` / `GGML_CUDA` exist; only the CPU path has been
tested so far. `chatterbox` has a `--n-gpu-layers N` flag — need to wire
the same through to `chatterbox-tts` and then actually run it.

Work items:
- Wire `--n-gpu-layers` on `chatterbox-tts`.
- Verify each custom op has a GPU kernel. Known fine on GPU:
  `flash_attn_ext`, `mul_mat`, `conv_1d` via im2col (standard),
  `soft_max`, `norm`. Probably fine: `ggml_sin` / `ggml_exp` /
  `ggml_leaky_relu` / `ggml_gelu_erf`. Need verification:
  `ggml_conv_1d` with **F32** `im2col` path (we pass `GGML_TYPE_F32` to
  keep conv kernels F32), `ggml_conv_transpose_1d`.
- Validate numerical parity — GPU `flash_attn_ext` often runs F16
  internally; confirm rel error vs PyTorch stays <1e-4.

Scope: 1–2 days if everything "just works", up to ~a week if two or three
ops need custom wiring or fallbacks.

Impact: on Apple M-series Metal, RTF should comfortably drop **below 0.1**
(sub-second generation for most utterances). Desktop discrete GPU: lower
still. **The single biggest speedup lever left.**

#### A3. Quantize T3 — ✅ **DONE** (Q8_0 / Q5_0 / Q4_0)

T3 (GPT-2 Medium, ~700 MB in F16) is the memory-bandwidth-dominated
component in the pipeline. Implemented via `--quant {f16,q8_0,q5_0,q4_0}`
flag in `scripts/convert-t3-turbo-to-gguf.py`.

The Python `gguf` 0.18 package has the K-quants (Q4_K / Q5_K / Q6_K)
declared but raises `NotImplementedError` in their `quantize_blocks`
implementations, so only legacy block types (`Q4_0`, `Q5_0`, `Q8_0`) are
produced here. Running the F16 GGUF through llama.cpp's `llama-quantize`
tool would work too, producing true K-quants — not done yet.

Only the big 2-D `mul_mat` weights get quantized: per-layer
`attn/c_attn/w`, `attn/c_proj/w`, `mlp/c_fc/w`, `mlp/c_proj/w`, plus
`chatterbox/speech_head`. Biases, layer norms, embeddings,
positional encoding, and the tokenizer metadata all stay at their
original dtype (F32 / F16). No C++ changes — `ggml_mul_mat` with
quantized weights + F32 activations is already a fast path.

Measured results, same prompt and `--n-predict 200` (201 tokens output):

**10-core EPYC** (remote):

| Variant | GGUF size | T3 wall time | vs F16 |
|---------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| F16     | 736 MB    | 3.91 s       | 1.00×  |
| Q8_0    | 460 MB    | 2.85 s       | **1.37× faster** |
| Q5_0    | 350 MB    | 2.58 s       | 1.52× faster |
| Q4_0    | 313 MB    | 2.38 s       | 1.64× faster |

**10-core Mac16,12** (M-series):

| Variant | T3 wall time | vs F16 |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| F16     | 14.92 s      | 1.00×  |
| Q8_0    | 5.41 s       | **2.76× faster** |
| Q5_0    | 5.27 s       | 2.83× faster |
| Q4_0    | 4.74 s       | 3.15× faster |

The Mac speedup is disproportionately large because M-series is much
more memory-bandwidth-bound on F16 than EPYC's DDR5 is.

Quality, comparing output tokens on a long prompt:
- **Q8_0**: **bit-for-bit identical** to F16. No audible or measurable
  quality loss. **Recommended default for quantized builds.**
- **Q5_0**: sampling diverges starting around token 6. Audio output still
  sounds correct; small perceptible voice-identity shift.
- **Q4_0**: sampling diverges slightly earlier and more. Audio still
  intelligible, with more drift from the F16 reference voice.

S3Gen / HiFT weights are conv-dominated (F16 on CFM linears actually
regressed on CPU — see §3.8 Attempt 7), so those stay F32.

Remaining: Q4_K / Q5_K path. Drop-in win would come from
`llama-quantize models/chatterbox-t3-turbo.gguf /out.gguf Q4_K_M`
once that tool's loader is pointed at our non-llama GGUF, or by
porting one of the K-quant kernels to the Python `gguf` package.

### Tier B — serious work, impactful for specific use cases

#### B1. Streaming / chunked generation for first-token latency

The current pipeline is "wait 2.4 s then hear all 8.6 s at once". For
interactive apps, **first-audio-out latency** matters more than
total RTF.

What to port:
- Chatterbox's `S3GenStreamer` path in Python: interleaves T3
  token-generation with chunked S3Gen / HiFT runs, overlap-adds their
  waveforms at the seams.
- Adds `flow_cache`, `cache_source`, `mel_cache` parameters we've been
  setting to empty, plus the overlap-add math for the HiFT vocoder.
- Emit audio to stdout (or a callback) as each chunk comes out.

Scope: ~**1 week**, mostly because the overlap-add math has to match
Python byte-for-byte or seams click.

Impact: **first audio chunk out in ~200–400 ms** instead of 2+ s. Turns
the binary from "batch" into "live".

#### B2. Server mode with persistent graphs

Every invocation currently pays ~200–400 ms fixed cost for graph
construction + `gallocr_reserve` + model load. Amortizing these over a
long-running process is free wall-time for a deployed service.

What to do:
- Daemonize with a simple stdio JSON-RPC or HTTP interface.
- Extend the `cfm_estimator_cache` pattern (from §3.8 Attempt 4) to the
  encoder and HiFT graphs — keep them pre-reserved across requests.
- Tensor shapes depend on input length → either: (a) LRU of per-length
  graphs, (b) pad to a fixed max length + attention mask, or (c) rebuild
  on shape change but pool the buffers.

Scope: **2–3 days**.

Impact: for repeated short utterances on the same server, another **20–30 %**
off wall time on top of the current RTF 0.28.

### Tier C — nice polish, niche

#### C1. Custom fused Conformer attention op (with rel-pos bias)

The S3Gen encoder's 10 Conformer blocks couldn't use `flash_attn_ext`
because they add ESPnet relative positional bias *inside* the softmax
(see §3.8 Attempt 8). A custom op that does
`softmax(QKᵀ/√d + B) · V` with B pre-computed `[L, T, H]` would fuse
those too.

Scope: **3–5 days** — CPU AVX-512 kernel first, Metal/CUDA once (A2) is
online.

Impact: maybe 50–100 ms off encoder (~10 % of encoder, which is already
only 12 % of the pipeline). Small in absolute terms; does get you the
same fusion level throughout.

#### C2. Batch generation

Multiple utterances in one pass. Python supports it; our C++ pipeline
assumes batch=1 throughout. Only matters at scale (multiple concurrent
users).

#### C3. Repository / packaging polish

- **GitHub Actions CI** running `compare-tokenizer.py` + `test-s3gen ALL`
  on every push. All the validation infrastructure is already in place;
  wiring it takes a few hours.
- **Prebuilt GGUFs on Hugging Face** so end users don't need the
  Python toolchain at all. Upload the two `.gguf` files with a model
  card explaining the build.
- **Library API** (not just binaries). Expose
  `chatterbox_synthesize(text, opts) -> wav` as a C / C++ API so
  Swift / Node.js / Python bindings can layer on top. ~Half a day.

### Recommended next-up order

For maximum usefulness per day of effort:

1. **A3 — Quantize T3** (~4 h) → instant size/speed win, essentially
   risk-free.
2. **A1 — Voice cloning** (2–3 days) → unlocks the flagship
   Chatterbox feature; without it this is only a demo.
3. **A2 — Metal backend** (1–2 days if smooth) → biggest speedup left;
   Mac users feel it immediately.
4. **B1 — Streaming** (~1 week) → what gets this into interactive apps.
5. **C3 — CI + prebuilt GGUFs** — pick up before announcing publicly.

B2 (server mode) and C1 (custom Conformer attn op) are worth doing once a
concrete deployment is pressuring for them; right now the CPU numbers are
already well past real-time for CLI use.
